Responsive Portfolio

Web accessibility/responsiveness across devices is an increasingly important aspect of programming, especially during this era of rapidly evolving technology. This project involved creating a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS components. The header, page content, and footer were designed to easily accommodate most devices and browser sizes by implementing specific responsive features. The adaptive navbar also provides easy access to different parts of the site.
